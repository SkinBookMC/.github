You can create your own personalized profile page with plenty of customizations, and using our [mod](https://github.com/skinbookmc/mod), you can integrate your Minecraft statistics directly into your profile.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SkinBook is currently in its early pre-alpha stages. Issues are expected, and feedback is very appreciated.
